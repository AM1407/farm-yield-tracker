A simple and intuitive farm management tool built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and vanilla JavaScript.

The app allows farmers to record daily yields for different animals (such as cows, goats, and chickens) through a responsive web form. Totals are automatically calculated and displayed in real time.

A secondary page simulates a database view, listing all entries to provide a printable overview of daily production.

The project is designed as a foundation for future full-stack development — later versions may include real database integration, authentication, and species-specific analytics (e.g., milk quality, feed tracking, or antibiotic logs).

Tech Stack:

"HTML5"

"CSS3 / Bootstrap"

"JavaScript (ES6)"

"LocalStorage (simulated data persistence)"

Project Goals:

"Practice separation of concerns between structure, style, and logic"

"Demonstrate front-end data handling without external APIs"

"Lay the groundwork for a future farm management application"
